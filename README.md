A site of now-playing and top-rated movies. Up-to-date using [The Movie DB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org)

# Challenge 
* Not easy to have a clear flow at the beginning for a beginner, easy to endup with a mess of small components. 
* Many will-know-in-future tools. Now using very basic tools so get to know that how usefull those in-the-future-tools will be.
* Bootstrap is suck in react. there are many packages (**Pagination, slider,etc...**) available, but the available ones are sometimes ugly @.@. Although many packages, libaries are provied but they are inconsistent as a whole.  Reactstrap is still limited. 
* Overall, It is a very usefull work to do, that covers up almost main concepts of react.
